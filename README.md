# doingDone
## A To-Do app for young families (and anyone else who needs reminding to do the boring things in life)

## How it works

1. Someone in the family (presumably a parent - AKA "_Approver_") creates tasks and assigns users to those tasks
2. Every day a list of tasks is created for each user
3. User completes task
4. The _Approver_ approves the task setting the level of completion and the amount of intervention required (i.e. if the task is done without prompting intervention would be 0, if the task doer was repeatedly prompted and cajolled to complte the task intervention would be 3) and points are assigned (also if the household implements pocket money each task gets a calculated dollar value)
5. Throughout the week points (and if applicable dollars) are awarded. Task doers can see their progress

## Todo

1. Get sort out time management.
2. Get local persistance working.
3. Implement regular and random date recurrance for tasks
4. Implement user management
5. Implement household settings
6. Implement pocket money & reward management
7. Implement personal goals
8. Get local persistance synced with cloud/server
